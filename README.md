# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
Puzzle solutions to Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## Goal
My goal is to solve each of the challenges with fully-typed Python in a reasonable amount of time. Not every solution may be fully optimized but they should be reasonably performant with little duplication.

Each part has its own code file (denoted by `a.py` and `b.py` suffixes). Since some parts within the same challenge can include interesting twists, I tend to copy the first part into the second part.

## Running
To run one of the advent solutions, `cd` into the directory and then run whichever part you want:
```sh
cd advent6/
python3 advent6a.py
```

Most advent solutions have a corresponding test associated with them that can be run similarly:
```sh
cd advent6/
python3 test_advent6a.py
```
